"At the age of 80, I appreciate the fact that I still have the privilege to do this work and still enjoy teaching children." 
The owner of PRT, Tiensie Kruger, has been teaching for about 50 years in many different schools including Westrand School for Cerebral palsy children. She has managed to grant each learner a better future. The love for teaching children has never disappeared and succeeding is the number one priority in Tiensie Kruger's classroom. Tiensie Kruger wants to give learners extra classes, because she wants to help them succeed with their schoolwork. She wants to be a helping-hand for learners.

PRT offers private one-on-one extra remedial classes for Grade 1 to 4 learners. These extra classes will help learners to feel more confident in their schoolwork. Learners will receive individual help where they struggle with their schoolwork. Individual help motivates learners to perform without stress because the classes focus on helping learners with extra help. Each extra class begins with physical exercises to distract learners from schoolwork and feel comfortable in the classroom. These exercises includes stretching, jumping, hopping, and directional exercises where learners are able to identify their left and right. Next, Teacher Tiensie asks learners how they are doing to check-in on their wellbeing. Afterwards, the real work begins where Teacher Tiensie goes through the learners homework with them and identify what they struggle with, thus focusing on that until the learner gets it correct.
Currently, the business is located at Ruimsig Academy, where extra classes are given to learners that attend Ruimsig Academy. The option where extra classes can be provided at your house is available in the following areas: Ruimsig, RandparkRidge, and Roodepoort.
