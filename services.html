                Extra classes are given to support learners in their schoolwork and advance to the next grade.
                Our extra

                English consists out of Reading and Writing as they are important fundamentals for each learner to
                master during their educational journey. <b>Reading</b> focusses on teaching each learner how to read
                and pronounce sounds and words correctly, as well as advising them depending on their level.
                <b>Writing</b> is assessed by looking at how learners are able to write, and methods are provided to
                help
                learners achieve neat and correct writing.
                <br>
                <b>Maths</b> are the building blocks in learner's education. Various Math exercises are given so that
                learners can practice all Mathematical topics. Learners are able to learn from their mistakes in these
                practices.

            <h3>Working Procedures</h3>
            <p>
                Each new student is evaluated by Teacher Tiensie to see what level they are to determine further
                classes.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                At the moment, extra classes are given to learners that attend Ruimsig Academy. Therefore, each learner
                has a time scheduled with Teacher Tiensie. <b>These times range from 9am till 2pm on a Wednesday and
                    Thursday.</b>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Each week a progress report is done on each learner and feedback will be given to parents to show what
                the learner achieved and where the learner still needs help with.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                There is continous communication between Teacher Tiensie and the learner's Teacher.
            </p>
