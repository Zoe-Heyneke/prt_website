            <h2>What makes PRT unique?</h2>
            <p>At PRT, there is great determination to help each learner with their schoolwork, especially to
                excel in their subjects. Each learner gets their own private time with Teacher Tiensie. Parents receive
                progress reports to see that Teacher Tiensie improves their skills each week. The environment offered at
                PRT, is motivation and a strive for success!

                        The end goal is to achieve success in the learner's education and that the learners are

            <h2>Success Stories</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Petrus</h3>
            <p>Petrus was in Teacher Tiensie's Grade 2 class when she taught full-time at Oos Skool, now known as
                Millenium. After Petrus finished school, he stepped on a landmine during his time in the Army and lost
                both his eyes. Regardless
                of this, Petrus and Teacher Tiensie have been in contact to this day. The significance of their
                story is the reciprication of their relationship: Teacher Tiensie taught Petrus how to read and
                write, and now Petrus has taught Teacher Tiensie how to use braille on a phone.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Adri</h3>
            <p>Adri was in Teacher Tiensie's class in Grade 1 until Grade 3 in Westrand School for Physically
                Disabled Children. Afterwards, she was transferred to general school, Highschool, and then finished
                University
                with multiple Degrees in Teaching. Now, Adri has begun her career as a teacher, following in the
                footsteps
                of Teacher Tiensie.</p>
